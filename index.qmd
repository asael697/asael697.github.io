Hello, I'm Asael, a statistician who programs in R, loves-hates Python, plays too much Pokemon, talks a lot, is crazy about traveling, and gets depressed often. Welcome to my blog! :). If you want to know more about my work, please check this section where I brag [about myself](about.qmd) or take home a paper ([CV](CVAsaelWork.pdf)) for free XD. 

**Important:** If you are a developer, R fanatic, or statistician, please star my [bayesforecast package](https://github.com/asael697/bayesforecast).

## Asael, an attempt at website/Blogging, again?! 

Yes! If you are reading me now, you might notice that I need practice in my writing, so I am doing this website for three different purposes:

  - Improve my [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) skills by presenting some time-series analyses using those languages.

  - Practice my English writing by saturating everyone, including myself.
  
  - Present all those little works and collaborations I do in a compact (*bounded and closed*) set.
  
## So, what's going on with my life now?

After three long years abroad studying, traveling, researching, snow, journal rejections, and surviving this sh@#t-show (COVID). I decided to return home, which was a difficult and messy choice. This webpage is my new attempt to organize my thoughts after this unique experience. No more elevator talks! Let me introduce you to my blog: [Depression and other stories](https://asael697.github.io/DOF/)!

**Spoilers alert**: I like to sing out loud with my headphones on in public spaces, so if you find a dude badly singing at a coffee shop in front of the computer, it's me! Please say hi! :).
