Hello, I'm Asael, a statistician that programs in R, love-hates Python, plays way too much Pokemon, talks a lot, is crazy for traveling, and gets depressed often. Welcome to my blog! :). 

If want to know more about my work, please check this section where I brag [about myself](about.qmd) or take home a paper ([CV](CVAsaelWork.pdf)) for free XD. 

  + **Spoilers alert**: I like to sing out loud with my headphones on in public spaces, so if you find a dude badly singing at a coffee shop in front of the computer, it's me! Please say hi! :).
  
  + **Btw:** I am currently obsessed with Aurora, Parcels, Bandalos Chinos, Tux Lunan, Jungle and Foals.
  
  + **Important:** If you are a developer, R fanatic, or statistician, please star my [bayesforecast package](https://github.com/asael697/bayesforecast).

## Asael, an attempt of website/Blog, again?! 

Well, yes! One of my major flaws is my English writing, so I am doing this website for three different purposes:

  - Improve my [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) skills by presenting some time-series analyses using those languages.
  
  - Practice my English writing by saturating everyone, including myself, with this bullsh@#t.
  
  - Present all those little works and collaborations I do in a compact (*bounded and closed*) set.
  
## So what's going on with my life now?

After three long years abroad studying, traveling, researching, surviving this sh@#t-show (COVID), snow, and rejections, I am going home! For now, this webpage is my new attempt to organize my mess.

If you want to know more about it or are having a heavy season and want somebody to talk to, send me a friend request or mail me. Who knows, you might have a new friend :).
