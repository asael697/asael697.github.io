One of my major flaws is my English writing, so I am doing this website for three different purposes:\n\nImprove my R, Python, and Julia skills by presenting some time-series analyses using those languages.\nPractice my English writing by saturating everyone, including myself, with this bullsh@#t.\nPresent all those little works and collaborations I do in a compact (bounded and closed) set."
